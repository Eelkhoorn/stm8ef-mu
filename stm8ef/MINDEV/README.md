## STM8 eForth "MINDEV" configuration

This folder contains the STM8 eForth configuration files for the common "MINDEV" STM8S103F3P6 breakout board.

The board configuration provides the word `OUT!` for controlling the LED connected to PB5. Otherwise it's very similar to [STM8S103F3](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/tree/master/STM8S103F3).

The binary release contains the image MINDEV which which can be used for any Low Density device that communicates through the STM8 UART. Note that for the [STM8S001J3](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/tree/master/STM8S001J3) a half-duplex binary is provided as a safer "no-lockout" option.

Documenation for this board is in the [Wiki](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/Breakout-Boards#stm8s103f3p6-breakout-board).
