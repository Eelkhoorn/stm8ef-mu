** Fix ARM asm control structures

** decide - or punt - on generalised literal question - , vs a, . Make it explicit? make literal and aliteral compiler words? make meta ' smart so it changes the type of literal that ] will compile? Or assume we've solved the problem, and push more compilation into the phase when we're -running- the colon compiler in the image, rather than running the meta-compiler.

** connect number input to mp-math um* and test target's number input code in muforth - based on the older double-number startup.mu4.

** define target's does>

** possibly deprecate (remove) metac does>

** error-handling solution. zen-style preset (or set) and reset?

** ARM disasm should show offsets and immed values in hex

** ARM disasm should show register names that correspond to what was defined in metac and/or kernel. how to specify? pass a "mapping" routine?

** remove macro: and replace with a "stream quoting" mechanism that would be used inside "normal" host forth words?

** add self-referential names for code of primitives (docolon etc) to make decompiling prettier

** fix decompiler to use above names

** du vs see vs i modes?

** clean up and organise metac

** redef control structure words in asm to :if :then etc so they don't collide?
