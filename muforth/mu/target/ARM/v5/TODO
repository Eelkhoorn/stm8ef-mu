Check that the register order is the same, with the exception of Rd, as the
ARM assembler.

After the last few instructions, figure out how to do literal pools.

Someday I'll have to add the ARM7TDMI instructions, including the Thumb
stuff, but mostly the extended multiplies and load/store signed and
halfword stuff.

Check out the LH7790. Get a datasheet?
